# NETFIX

## Requirements:
### CASE

A client has asked you to design an on-demand movie subscription service and they want a REST API to manage their users and subscription. We like you to code a part of it.

The following list is what tasks you need to complete:
1.       Add subscription: Add a movie to userâ€™s subscription lists.
2.       Remove subscription: Remove a movie from the subscription lists.
3.       View subscription: View all movies subscribed by a user.

## Installation:
1. Make sure that no server/service is running on port `:80`
2. `$ cd docker && docker-compose up -d`
3. `$ docker exec netfix_back bash -c "composer install"`

## Running:
Go to `http://localhost`.
